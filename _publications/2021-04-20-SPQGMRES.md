The main aim of this paper is to develop the quaternion generalized minimal residual method (QGMRES) for solving quaternion linear systems. Quaternion linear systems arise from three-dimensional or color imaging filtering problems. The proposed quaternion Arnoldi procedure can preserve quaternion Hessenberg form during the iterations. The main advantage is that the storage of the proposed iterative method can be reduced by comparing with the Hessenberg form constructed by the classical GMRES iterations for the real representation of quaternion linear systems. The convergence of the proposed QGMRES is also established. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed QGMRES compared with the traditional GMRES in terms of storage and computing time.
