This paper presents a randomized quaternion singular value decomposition (QSVD) algorithm for low-rank matrix approximation problems, which are widely used in color face recognition, video compression, and signal processing problems. With quaternion normal distribution-based random sampling, the randomized QSVD algorithm projects high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional subspace and then identifies an approximate range subspace of the quaternion matrix. The key statistical properties of quaternion Wishart distribution are proposed and used to perform the approximation error analysis of the algorithm. Theoretical results show that the randomized QSVD algorithm can trace dominant singular value decomposition triplets of a quaternion matrix with acceptable accuracy. Numerical experiments also indicate the rationality of proposed theories. Applied to color face recognition problems, the randomized QSVD algorithm obtains higher recognition accuracies and behaves more efficient than the known Lanczos-based partial QSVD and a quaternion version of the fast frequent directions algorithm.
