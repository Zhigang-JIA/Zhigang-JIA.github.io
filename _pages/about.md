I am a professor and doctoral supervisor at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Jiangsu Normal University. My current research interests are numerical algebra and image processing.

I received my Ph.D. from East China Normal University in July 2009. I have previously been a visiting scholar at the University of Manchester, Hong Kong Baptist University, and the University of Macau.
