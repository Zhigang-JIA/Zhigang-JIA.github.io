In this talk, we introduce a new incremental tensor singular value decomposition model for face recognition. This model extracts facial features by the incremental tensor singular value decomposition that utilizes both the computed tensor singular value decomposition of the original training data and the projection of the additional data. The feasibility is theoretically analyzed and new algorithms are presented. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed model and algorithm have better performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms.

Key contributions include:

- New incremental tensor singular value decomposition model.

This approach demonstrates a promising direction for augmented data decomposition using existing tensor SVD decomposition.

Presented by **Zhigang Jia**, Jiangsu Normal University, at Nanning 2025.
